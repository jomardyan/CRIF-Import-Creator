[![Build and Release](https://github.com/jomardyan/CRIF-Import-Creator/actions/workflows/build-and-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jomardyan/CRIF-Import-Creator/actions/workflows/build-and-release.yml)
[![CI Build](https://github.com/jomardyan/CRIF-Import-Creator/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jomardyan/CRIF-Import-Creator/actions/workflows/ci.yml)


Create an import-ready file for the [CRIF](https://www.crif.pl/) data exchange system.

## Quick Start

### Download
Get the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jomardyan/CRIF-Import-Creator/releases).

**Recommended:** Download `CRIF-Encrypt-vX.X.X-win-x64-standalone.zip` - No .NET installation required!

### Usage

1. Save your MS Excel export as a Unicode Text file (.txt, .TXT).
2. Drag the exported file onto `CRIF-Encrypt.exe`.
3. Alternatively, you can pass the file path as an argument via the command line:
   ```bash
   CRIF-Encrypt.exe "path/to/your/file.txt"
   ```
4. The program will automatically output a `.gpg` file, which is ready to be imported into the CRIF system.

## üîß How It Works
1. The working file's encoding is converted to UTF-8.
2. The `^~` separator is added.
3. The file is converted to a `.DAT` file.
4. The `.DAT` file is packed into a ZIP archive as required.
5. The file is signed and encrypted. The program will prompt you to enter the signing password.
